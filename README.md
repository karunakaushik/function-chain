Here’s a detailed guide to set up and run the project locally:

###### Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

        Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
        npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn as a package manager
        Git (for cloning the repository)

        1. Clone the Repository:
            Open a terminal or command prompt.
            Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
            
                git clone <repository_url>
            Replace <repository_url> with the actual GitHub repository link
        2. Move into the directory containing the project files:  cd <project-folder>
        3. Install Dependencies : npm install or npm i
           Or, if you’re using yarn: yarn install
        4. Start the local development server: npm run dev
            Or, if you’re using yarn: yarn dev
